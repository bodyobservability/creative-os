# Corp Asset Intake 2026 CSV Spec

## Purpose
Represent **assets acquired by the C-corp in 2026** (especially purchases from founder) in a boring CSV that can be handed to bookkeeping.

This is distinct from a C-corp expense: assets are capitalized and depreciated.

## File
`corp_asset_intake_2026.csv`

## Schema
```csv
corp_asset_id,source_asset_id,acquisition_type,acquisition_date,vendor_or_source,description,purchase_price_2026,original_purchase_date,category,serial,location,evidence_path
```

## Field Semantics
- `corp_asset_id`: corp-side unique id (e.g. `corp-<bundle_id>`)
- `source_asset_id`: originating bundle/asset id (for provenance)
- `acquisition_type`: `purchase_from_founder` | `retail_purchase` | `contribution`
- `acquisition_date`: date corp takes ownership (and places in service if applicable)
- `vendor_or_source`: `founder` for founder sales; otherwise vendor name
- `description`: human-readable asset description
- `purchase_price_2026`: amount paid by corp in 2026
- `original_purchase_date`: when founder originally acquired (for context only)
- `category`: Creative-OS category (for internal allocation)
- `serial`: optional serial/identifier
- `location`: optional location
- `evidence_path`: pointer to ReceiptBundle / evidence archive

## Rules
- This CSV is **corp-facing**; it must never be imported into personal Schedule C.
- For founder sales, `purchase_price_2026` should be the agreed sale price (often FMV).
- If `purchase_price_2026` is blank, treat as draft and require review.
