# FINISHING RITUAL

Goal: produce a release-ready master in one pass, with zero creative decisions.

## Steps
1. Export WAV from Voloco (source of truth).
2. Open the chosen finishing bay:
   - Primary: `HVLIEN_FINISHING_BAY_v1.als`
   - Dark: `HVLIEN_FINISHING_BAY_DARK.als`
   - Light: `HVLIEN_FINISHING_BAY_LIGHT.als`
3. Drag the WAV onto `VOLOCO_STEM`.
4. Confirm:
   - Warp is OFF for the clip
   - Track layout and device order are unchanged
5. Arm `MASTER_PRINT`.
6. Play once from start to end.
7. Stop.
8. Export `MASTER_PRINT` using the preset:
   - WAV 24-bit / 48kHz
   - Normalize OFF
   - Dither OFF

## Rule
If it sounds wrong: do not edit the track. Fix the bay and re-print.
