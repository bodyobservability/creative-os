# FAILURE MODES

This document defines first-response actions when something goes wrong.

## 1) Ableton crash / hang
- Relaunch Ableton.
- Reopen the same bay.
- Re-run the finishing ritual.
- Do not improvise routing changes.

## 2) Interface disconnect / audio dropouts
- Check USB-C cables and ports.
- Power-cycle AUDIO4c if needed.
- Verify sample rate is 48kHz.
- Increase buffer from 64 -> 128 if crackling persists.

## 3) Output clipping
- Reduce Limiter input gain first.
- If persistent, reduce Saturator drive slightly.
- Do not normalize exports.

## 4) Track sounds “off”
- Reconfirm Warp OFF.
- Confirm device order unchanged.
- Print again. If still off, adjust the bay (not the track) and bump version if needed.

## Rule
If uncertain, do nothing and re-run the ritual.
