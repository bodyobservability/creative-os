name: MODAL_CANCEL_TEST_V1
goal: Verify Voice Control can dismiss a macOS Open dialog deterministically.
assumptions:
  voice_control:
    overlays: numbers_grid
    dictation: enabled
user_prep:
  - Open TextEdit (or any safe app)
  - Trigger Open dialog (Command O) and leave it visible

steps:
  - say: "Show numbers"
  - say: "Click Cancel"
  - say: "Press Escape"
  - say: "Press Escape"
  - verify: { expected: "Dialog closed", method: "visual" }

notes:
  - This is a human-facing sanity check; v4 safety also includes a modal guard test.
