# Sonic baselines

Baselines are stored as sweep receipts (v7.2) and referenced by v8 certify/promote workflows.

Conventions:
- profiles/hvlien/specs/sonic/baselines/<rack_id>/<Macro>.baseline.v1.json
- Optionally maintain an index: profiles/hvlien/specs/sonic/baselines/baseline_index.v1.json

v8.5 adds CLI helpers to set/get/list baselines safely.
