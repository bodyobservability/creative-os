# Operator Shell Voice + Studio Modes

Version: current


Adds:
- Voice Mode (`v`): numbered actions + “Say 'press N'” prompts; number keys 1–9 select.
- Studio Mode (`s`): safe-only list by default (hides risky commands).

This is designed for Tahoe Voice Control workflows and low-anxiety studio sessions.
