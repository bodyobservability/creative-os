# Polymath OS Doctrine

Creative OS is a polymath operating system: a single execution grammar that supports many domains
(music, video, photography, textiles, medical devices, spatial systems) without embedding domain semantics into the kernel.

This is not branding. These are enforceable architectural rules.

## Principles

### 1) One kernel, many materials
The kernel defines execution semantics (plan -> gate -> execute -> receipt).
Domains supply data, constraints, and operator workflows -- never kernel semantics.

### 2) Determinism is the creative substrate
Creative iteration must be reproducible:
- Plans are explicit
- Mutations are gated
- Receipts are immutable
- Derived artifacts are traceable to source + intent

### 3) Authority is separated from affordance
Operators provide workflows, UI, voice, and convenience.
Only the kernel authorizes execution.

### 4) Shared contracts define truth
Specs and contracts are authoritative across domains.
They are validated by the kernel and versioned like code.

### 5) Safety scales with consequence
The same gating + receipt model must remain intact as consequence increases:
music -> video -> materials -> devices -> body-coupled systems.

### 6) No hidden execution
If a change matters, it must leave evidence:
- receipts
- diffs
- schema-validated inputs

## Non-goals

- The kernel does not "understand" domains.
- Operator personas are not peers to the kernel.
- Convenience is never allowed to bypass auditability.

---

## Implication

If Creative OS can safely operate a studio station today, it can safely operate a fabrication or medical-adjacent workflow tomorrow --
without rewriting the kernel.
