# Accounting Operator — Profile

This profile defines an **episodic** operator role for closing accounting epochs (e.g., tax year 2025).

## Primary interface
- Repo Launcher: `make launcher`
- Accounting TUI: `make tui` (guided Space workflow)

## What it optimizes for
- Truthful ownership boundaries: personal vs sole proprietor vs C-corp
- Deterministic exports (Schedule C, corp reimbursements, corp asset intake)
- Audit-ready evidence retention (local-only)

## Non-goals
- Bookkeeping / double-entry
- Automatic tax filing
- Inbox mutation
