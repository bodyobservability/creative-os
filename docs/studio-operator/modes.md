# Modes

These are Studio Operator shell modes. Creative OS kernel gating still decides what can execute.

## SAFE

- Studio Mode ON
- Risky actions hidden (exports, fix, repair, certify)
- View is locked

## GUIDED

- Studio Mode OFF
- Curated essentials, includes some risky actions

## ALL

- Studio Mode OFF
- Full surface area

## One-liner

If you can’t find Export ALL, you’re in SAFE.


Tip: press `?` in the Operator Shell for a full legend and key list.
