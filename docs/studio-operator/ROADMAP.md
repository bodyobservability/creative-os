# Studio Operator Roadmap

Operator-only milestones for Studio Operator. Cross-cutting milestones that affect kernel semantics live in `docs/creative-os/ROADMAP.md`.

---

## Operator-Only Milestones

- Define Studio Operator onboarding checkpoints and ensure they are fully receipted.
- Establish a consistent operator workflow taxonomy across studio stations.

---

## Dependencies on Kernel

- Requires kernel validation for any new operator workflows that mutate state.
- Requires kernel updates only when new receipts or shared contracts are introduced.

---

## Near-Term

- Expand runbook coverage for critical operator workflows.
- Tighten operator notes into deterministic checklists.

---

## Later

- Add additional studio personas or sub-personas without changing kernel semantics.
