# Accounting Operator - Profiles

This directory anchors the Accounting Operator persona's profile materials.

The canonical profile file currently lives at:
- `operator/profiles/accounting.profile.yaml`

This directory exists so persona manifests can truthfully declare asset roots and so future additions
(notes, runbooks, templates) have a stable home.

Profiles express intent and policy; they are not execution authority.
