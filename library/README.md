# library/

Repo placeholder describing how to organize the existing catalog for backfill (not committed content).

Recommended on-disk structure:

/profiles/hvlien/library/
  RAW_UPLOADS/        # Voloco WAV exports (canonical)
  MASTERS/            # finished masters (WAV preferred)
  LOSSY_REFERENCES/   # mp3/m4a (reference only)

For v1.1 backfill, prioritize WAV exports and WAV masters.
