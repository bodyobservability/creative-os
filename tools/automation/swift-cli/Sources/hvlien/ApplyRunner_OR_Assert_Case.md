# ApplyRunner v6.5 OR case

This autopatch provides a replacement ApplyRunner.swift snippet is not safe without repo context.
Instead, it ships a small Swift file you can include that defines a helper, and you must add a switch case.

If you'd like, I can generate a repo-specific patch if you share your current ApplyRunner.swift.
